  [üêô] Pok√©mon Delta is an in-browser fan-made Pok√©mon RPG.
</p>

<br/><br/>
## Project
The project is currently **inactive**, as it was just created with the intention of practicing with P5.js and web-sockets (Socket.io).
Here are some brief reference images of the current game. Online functionalities including live movement, joining/quiting, and username-tags are all implemented. Additionally, map rendering, BGM handling, camera movement, player-control, and basic entitity management are all functional.

## Map Maker
Next to the game itself, there is a local website source intended as a tool for easily creating maps. Maps support an unlimited amount of layers and there are multiple paint tools to support the creation process. All the map's metadata such as spawn-location and BGM can also be configured. At the end, the user can press a button to generate a fully usable JavaScript file that represents the map and all its data.
